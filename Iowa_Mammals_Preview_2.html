    <div class="species">
        <h2>Eastern Cottontail (<em>Sylvilagus floridanus</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Eastern_Cottontail.jpg" alt="Eastern Cottontail">
        <p>The eastern cottontail is the most common rabbit in Iowa, found in grasslands, brushy fields, suburban yards, and woodland edges. It feeds on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, clover, and bark during winter months. Highly prolific, a single female may produce several litters per year.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Cottontails will freeze and rely on camouflage when threatened, but can run up to 18 mph in zigzag patterns when fleeing.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Statewide—especially common in disturbed and edge habitats.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="species">
        <h2>Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Vulpes_vulpes_laying_in_snow.jpg" alt="Red Fox">
        <p>Adaptable and widespread, red foxes are found throughout Iowa in farmlands, woodlands, and even near urban areas. They are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on rodents, insects, fruit, and carrion. Their dens are usually hidden in brush or burrows.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Red foxes use Earth's magnetic field as a targeting system when pouncing on prey.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Statewide in a variety of open and semi-open habitats.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="species">
        <h2>Coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Coyote_canis_latrans.jpg" alt="Coyote">
        <p>Coyotes are highly adaptable predators found across Iowa, including rural, suburban, and even some urban areas. They eat small mammals, fruits, insects, and carrion. Coyotes are typically shy and elusive, though their howls and yips are commonly heard at night.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Coyotes can form monogamous pairs that stay together for years, raising pups cooperatively.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Common statewide across most habitats.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="species">
        <h2>Bobcat (<em>Lynx rufus</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Bobcat2.jpg" alt="Bobcat">
        <p>Iowa's only wild feline, bobcats are elusive and mostly nocturnal. They prefer dense cover near water, including woodlands and brushy ravines. Bobcats prey on rabbits, rodents, birds, and even deer fawns. Once rare, their population is increasing, especially in southern Iowa.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Bobcats rarely meow—instead, they make yowls, hisses, and growls more typical of wild cats.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Primarily southern and eastern Iowa; expanding in range.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="species">
        <h2>Raccoon (<em>Procyon lotor</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Raccoon_procyon_lotor.jpg" alt="Raccoon">
        <p>Raccoons are nocturnal omnivores found throughout Iowa, easily recognized by their ringed tails and masked faces. They are intelligent and dexterous, often raiding garbage or crops, but they also hunt small animals and forage natural foods near water.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Raccoons can open jars, doors, and latches—some studies show them remembering solutions for over three years.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Statewide—especially near water, woodlands, and urban areas.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="species">
        <h2>White-tailed Deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/White-tailed_deer.jpg" alt="White-tailed Deer">
        <p>The most widespread large mammal in Iowa, white-tailed deer inhabit forests, fields, river valleys, and suburban edges. They browse leaves, twigs, crops, and acorns. Antlers are shed and regrown annually. Their population is managed by hunting seasons.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Deer can jump over 8 feet high and sprint up to 35 mph.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Statewide—thriving in both wild and human-influenced landscapes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="species">
        <h2>Virginia Opossum (<em>Didelphis virginiana</em>)</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Virginia_opossum.jpg" alt="Virginia Opossum">
        <p>North America’s only native marsupial, the opossum is common in Iowa. It has a prehensile tail, opposable thumbs on its hind feet, and a diet of insects, fruit, carrion, and even small animals. It often scavenges around human dwellings and plays dead when threatened.</p>
        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Opossums are nearly immune to snake venom and rarely contract rabies due to their low body temperature.</p>
        <p class="range">Range: Statewide—especially near woodlands, water, and urban edges.</p>
